Create a Facebook cover image with a captivating theme of the Kerala rainy season. The design should include the following elements:

Dimensions: The image should be 820 pixels wide by 312 pixels tall.
Background: Use a lush, green landscape typical of Kerala. The background should feature tropical elements such as coconut trees, dense foliage, and perhaps a serene backwater scene with traditional houseboats.
Weather Elements: Illustrate a gentle rain shower, with visible raindrops falling and creating ripples in water bodies. Include overcast skies with soft, grey clouds.
Main Element: In the foreground, show a traditional Kerala house or hut with a thatched roof, surrounded by nature. Optionally, include a person with an umbrella or a couple enjoying the rain to add a human touch.
Text: Add the text "Embrace the Monsoon Magic" in a stylish, elegant font. Position the text towards the center, ensuring it stands out but blends naturally with the scenery.
Accent Colors: Use natural colors that complement the lush greens and blues of the rainy season. Text should be in white or a light color to ensure readability against the vibrant background.
Additional Elements: Include small details such as blooming flowers, wet ground with reflections, and perhaps a distant view of the Western Ghats mountains shrouded in mist.
Authentic Touch: Incorporate traditional elements like an ‘Aranmula Kannadi’ (a unique metal mirror), a Kathakali dancer silhouette, or a traditional lamp to emphasize the cultural richness of Kerala.
